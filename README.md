# Wrote Myself a Git

Sooner or later, we all come to deal with Git and GitHub. I wondered if a basic version of Git could be built from scratch. In this repo, I build a simple version control system from scratch. 

I have relied on the following sources:
1. (Thibault Polge's Repository)[https://wyag.thb.lt/]
2. (Git Documentation)[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2]
