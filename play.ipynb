Having this structure ensures that on average most files are distributed across the 256 directories and any one directory doesn't get too big. Thus, improving speed and performance.

So in terms of the filesystem, the checkout command will take the commit hash and a directory as arguments. Then it will instantiate the tree from the hash and save it as a copy in the directory. We don't want to overwrite if there is any data already present in the directory. So our command only works if the directory is empty."
